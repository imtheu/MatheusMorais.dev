# Javascript Optional Chaining Operator (?.)

The Optional Chaining Operator (`?.`) is a JavaScript operator that lets you access properties of a object without doing explicit checks
(using an `if` statement, or a ternary operator (`condition ? expr1 : expr2`), for example) on the existence of the object itself.
And that's amazing, mainly because it's quite common to have several objects chained together, where some of them may be `null` or `undefined` in some application state.

## The problem

Let's see a very simple example:

Imagine that, in some state of my application, we'll have an object _user_ that will have another chained object called _contact_ that will have some contact properties:

```javascript
const user = {
	contact: {
		phone: '(000) 000-0000'
	}
};
```

But let's assume this contact data is not available in an initial state, so my _user_ object will be empty:

```javascript
const user = {};
```

With just what we have here, we can't know what state our application is in. Therefore, we will not be able to know if the _contact_ object exists in the _user_ object.
So... What happens if we try to access the properties of the _contact_ object in different states?

Well, if the _contact_ object is on _user_ as expected, then it'll work correctly:

```javascript
const user = {
	contact: {
		phone: '(000) 000-0000'
	}
};

console.log('Phone:', user.contact.phone);

// ✅ Works!
```

But if the _contact_ object is not yet in the _user_ object, then:

```javascript
const user = {};

console.log('Phone:', user.contact.phone);

// ❌ Uncaught TypeError:
//      Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'phone')
```

The _contact_ object hasn't been defined in the _user_ object yet, so we can't access its properties.

## Using the optional chain operator

As already said, there are several ways to solve this, but the optional chaining operator keeps everything very clean and simple:

```javascript
console.log('Phone:', user.contact?.phone);
//                           here ^
```

- If `user.contact` exists, then we will be able to access the `phone` property and display it.
- If `user.contact` is `null` or `undefined`, then the optional chaining operator will return `undefined` and will not even attempt to access the `phone` property.

### Possibilities

In addition to chained objects, we can use the operator in functions, and even in _arrays_:

- Functions:

  ```javascript
  const photo = user.viewPhoto?.();
  ```

  It will only run the _displayPhoto_ function if it isn't `null` or `undefined`. Otherwise, _photo_ will be `undefined`.

- Arrays:

  ```javascript
  const user = {
  	contacts: [{ phone: '(000) 000-0000' }, { phone: '(111) 111-1111' }]
  };

  const firstPhone = user.contacts?.[0]?.phone;
  ```

  Here we can see two possibilities:

  - In `contacts?.`, we check if the _contacts_ array already exists in the _user_ object, before proceeding to access the rest of the chain (which, in this case, is trying to access the first element of the array).
  - If `contacts?.` returned the array (instead of `undefined`), as expected, then we go ahead and check if the first element exists: `[0]?.`.
  - If we have gone through both optional chaining operators, then we are able to access the _phone_ property.
    If not, we'll have `undefined` as the value of the constant _firstPhone_.
