## Version 1

Doarei was developed while I was still studying web development. Although it's not as visually attractive, it's one of the jobs I'm most proud of.

The development stack was:

| Development | DevOps    | Structure   | Other tech       |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| PHP         | GIT       | Shared Host | Google Analytics |
| MySQL       | BitBucket | CPanel      | Google Adsense   |
| Javascript  | FTP       | APACHE      |
| JQuery      |           |             |
| Vanilla CSS |           |             |
| GULP        |           |             |

## Version 2 (Current)

Quickly, Doarei needed more care as well, meaning that it also needed an update in its technologies, improvements to make the code more maintainable, in addition to improvements in performance, accessibility, usability and SEO.

This is what one of our users told us:

> “Acho um trabalho lindo. Não pensam só em si, pensam também no próximo. Mais pessoas deveriam ter esse coração.”
>
> (I think it's a beautiful job. They don't just think about themselves, they also think about others. More people should have that heart.)
